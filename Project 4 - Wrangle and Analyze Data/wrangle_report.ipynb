    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, I will explain the entire wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing process that I have gone through.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs and includes a funny comment about the dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Gathering \n",
    "Here, I need to gather the data from several sources and in a variety of formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Twitter Archive dataframe** \n",
    "This file was available to download directly from the Udacity website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Image Prediction dataframe**\n",
    "I was using the Requests library to download this file from a URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Twitter API dataframe**\n",
    "I have used Udacity tweet json file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessing data \n",
    "In this section i will list all the Quality issues and\n",
    "Tidiness issues that i have found during assessing each dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Twitter Archive dataframe**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Quality issues :`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is two wrong data type for both (timestamp& retweeted_status_timestamp) should be converted to \"datetime\" insted of \"Object\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Many Mising values in multiple columns sush as (in_reply_to_status_id,in_reply_to_user_id,retweeted_status_id,retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp,expanded_urls).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A wrong data type for(tweet_id) should be converted to \"intger\" insted of \"object\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The \"rating denominator\" should be always/almost out of 10, but there are numerous other strange numbers, like ( 110,50,170....etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. There are numerous NaN values in the expanded urls column.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Some of the tweet does not iclude image.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The preducations name need to be captlized.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. long sources information replace it with someting more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. There is some tweet apears to be a juste retweet/replies.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Tidiness issues : `\n",
    "- \"Dog stages > doggo,floofer,pupper,puppo\" were discovered to be in multiple column so they should be combined into one column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Image Prediction dataframe**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Quality issues :`\n",
    "- There is missing images since it's only 2057 image out of 2356.\n",
    "- wrong datatype (tweet_id).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Tidiness issues : `\n",
    "- Shall be combined with the twitter archive data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Twitter API dataframe**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Quality issues :`\n",
    "- wrong datatype (tweet_id).\n",
    "- Missing tweets.\n",

    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I'll go over the cleaning process for the issues I discovered while assessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the tidiness issues, I have combined all four types of dog stages into one column instead of four, and then moving on to the second step, which is combining the three data set into one universal data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to the quality issues, I decided to remove the columns (in reply to status id,in reply to user id,retweeted status id,retweeted status user id,retweeted status user id,retweeted status timestamp,expanded urls) after discovering many missing values and unnecessary columns,I've also converted the datatypes \"timestamp and retweeted status timestamp\" from object to datetime, as well as the datatype \"tweet id\" from intger to object,\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, instead of having long and complex source information, replace it with something more readable.\n",
    "I also removed several NaN values from the expanded urls column.\n",
    "I also noticed that there were abnormal rates in the \"rating denominator\" where it should be always/almost out of 10, and I was able to identify them by applying a condition. I also noticed that some tweets did not include images, so I decided to remove these columns. Finally, I fixed the name of the prediction column by capitalizing the names."
