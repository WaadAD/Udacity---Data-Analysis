>The step journey in this project began with importing all of the packages, then uploading the dataset, and then beginning wrangling. After that, I made some observations and began cleaning up the issues that I faced, and finally, I began to visualize all of the charts.

## Summary of Findings

>I came to some conclusions following the visualization and exploration.
I discovered that men make up the majority of users, whether they are customers or subscribers, and that the 
Subscriber client was higher than the customer client,The majority of people who use bikes are between the ages of 20 and 40, and they are likely to dislike sharing them. I also learned that the most frequent starting and ending times are usually on weekdays rather than weekends, from seven in the morning until nine in the morning, and from four in the afternoon until six in the evening.  
I might say that there are some issues that I need to fix on and  such as some erroneous data types and some  missing values.


## Key Insights for Presentation

  2. The majority of the user member were men who had huge gab with other users.
